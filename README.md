# Team-Dynamics-Analyser

The Project Selection and Team Dynamics Analyzer is designed to assist users in choosing a project from a list of options and then assigning teams based on their preferences. Additionally, the project provides visualization of team dynamics to aid in decision-making.



Key Features:

Project Selection: Users are presented with a menu of project options to choose from. Upon making a selection, they proceed to the team assignment phase.

Team Assignment: Users are guided through the selection of teams for their chosen project. Teams are presented with varying levels of experience, and users select one based on their requirements.

Cost Calculation: The project calculates the total cost of the selected team(s) and displays it to the user. This includes a breakdown of costs and the addition of applicable taxes or fees.

Simulated Payment Process: To simulate a real-world transaction, the project redirects users to a payment link (in this case, a PayPal link) where they can complete the payment process. This step enhances the user experience by providing a realistic interaction.

Team Dynamics Visualization: The project includes a graphical representation of team dynamics using a line plot. Teams are plotted based on their experience levels, providing users with a visual understanding of the available options.



Conclusion:
The Project Selection and Team Dynamics Analyzer is a versatile tool that simplifies project selection, team assignment, and visualization of team dynamics. With its user-friendly interface and realistic simulation, it serves as a valuable resource for individuals and organizations seeking efficient project management solutions.
